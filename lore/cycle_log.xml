The _spawn_torches() function creates torch visuals with a glow ColorRect, but the glow effect is a simple static colored rectangle that pulses slightly. It's not an ambient glow shader/effect—it's just a ColorRect with basic sine-wave alpha/size modulation. True ambient glow would involve screen-space effects, bloom, or proper light nodes. The implementation is purely visual placeholder code, not a real ambient glow system." />
