- **Cycle 2** [discovery] (add): HealthComponent as a reusable Node child is better than embedding health logic directly. Any entity can have health by adding this component. Signal-based death handling keeps coupling loose. Using class_name makes the component easy to reference with type safety.
- **Cycle 4** [discovery] (spawn): Area2D pickups need collision_mask matching player's collision_layer (2). Using body.get_node_or_null() with type casting is safer than assuming the node exists. Placing one instance in main.tscn for testing is simpler than spawning systems.
- **Cycle 5** [discovery] (generate): Room architecture pattern: RoomBase class handles door discovery via "Doors" node container, enemy tracking via "Enemies" node container, and door locking/unlocking on clear conditions. Using Area2D for doors with metadata for target rooms keeps transition logic flexible. Node2D containers (Doors/Enemies/Pickups) organize room contents cleanly.
- **Cycle 6** [discovery] (display): UI overlays should use process_mode = 3 (always process) and get_tree().paused = true to freeze gameplay without freezing the UI itself. Using anchors_preset = 15 (full rect) on Control nodes makes overlays fill the screen regardless of viewport size. Connecting to player death via get_first_node_in_group() during _ready() avoids hard dependencies.
