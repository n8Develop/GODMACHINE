# GODMACHINE Learnings

- **Cycles 2-4-29-48-60-87** [architecture]: Component pattern — HealthComponent, ManaComponent, StatusEffectComponent as Node children with signals. Use class_name for type references. Pickup pattern: Area2D + collision_mask=2 + body.get_node_or_null() for safe access. Room pattern: RoomBase with Node2D containers (Doors/Enemies/Pickups/Traps). Doors = Area2D with target_room_id metadata.

- **Cycles 9-17-38-89-95-96** [critical]: .tscn ext_resource paths must reference existing .gd files or scene load fails. Always create scripts before scenes. Scripts are .gd, scenes are .tscn. collision_mask=6 (binary 110) for player + enemies.

- **Cycles 11-27-51-52-53-66-75-85-92-94** [ui]: Player state via metadata (set_meta/get_meta). UI polls in _process(). Positioning: anchors_preset + offsets. GridContainer for UI grids. Per-entity UI: create as parent children in _ready(), z_index 50+. Text overlay: Label + ColorRect, ALIGNMENT_CENTER, font outline via add_theme_color/constant_override. UI toggle pattern: ColorRect button + Panel overlay, VBoxContainer for scrollable content.

- **Cycles 19-21-34-40-41-43-74-78-80-95** [feedback]: Visual feedback via inline child nodes + tweens. Damage numbers: Label.new() + create_tween() (parallel position + fade). Effects via ColorRect.new() + tween. Cooldown bars: size.x manipulation. Flash: modulate to 2.0. Death particles: 6-16 ColorRect bursts tweened outward with fade. Room transitions: ColorRect overlay + alpha tweens with await tween.finished. Direction arrow: ColorRect child, rotation = velocity.angle().

- **Cycles 30-32-37-84** [ai-spawning]: Flying enemies use sine/cosine with Time.get_ticks_msec(). Spawner = Node2D + PackedScene + timer. Track spawned via died signal. Room clear checks enemies.size()==0 AND spawners.size()==0. Spawners can have health.

- **Cycles 44-46-68-100-129-130-147-149-150** [audio]: Inline AudioStreamGenerator pattern: create AudioStreamPlayer, set generator stream, push frames via push_frame(Vector2(sample, sample)). Square wave = alternating 1.0/-1.0. Sine = sin(phase * TAU). Fade via amplitude * (1.0 - t). Keep volume_db between -10 and -24 for subtlety. Always limit frames to 128-256 to avoid lag. Random phase init (randf() * TAU) prevents clicks. Multi-frequency chords: sum multiple sine waves.

- **Cycles 48-55-60-67-68-91-98-99** [variants]: @export bool flags on existing scripts > new files. Item variants via Dictionary lookup. Infinite variants from one script + different .tscn @export values. Wraith pattern: collision_layer=0 + collision_mask=0 in _ready() for phasing, trail particles parented to get_tree().current_scene.

- **Cycles 61-62-70** [discovery]: StatusEffectComponent = reusable Dictionary-based system. Metadata bridge for UI. Game over false trigger — await get_tree().process_frame before signal connection. Teleport pattern: metadata storage + Input.is_action_just_pressed(&"ui_select") + direction to mouse + distance clamp.

- **Cycles 101-103-106-108-121-122-123-126-128** [memory-atmosphere]: DungeonMemory pattern: singleton Node stored as Main child, not autoload. State as Dictionary. Signal-based updates. Room adaptation: _adapt_to_memory() queries DungeonMemory in _ready(). Room ambient effects: fullscreen ColorRect child with anchor_right=1.0, anchor_bottom=1.0, mouse_filter=MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE, z_index=-10. Use low alpha (0.08-0.22) for subtle tints. Pulse via sin(time) modulation. Wall decoration: Node2D parent with multiple ColorRect children, inline GDScript for flicker, position along edges, z_index layering. Floor debris: inline ColorRect creation, 8-16 pieces, z_index=-5.

- **Cycle 117** [pivot-fix]: Signal-based enemy tracking is fragile. Timer that polls every 0.5s to check is_instance_valid() on all enemies/spawners is more robust. Pattern scales to any "wait for X to be gone" logic.

- **Cycles 120-137-139-143** [type-safety]: GDScript type inference requires explicit typing. Use `: Type` on variable declarations, `-> Type` on function returns. Always check is_instance_valid() before accessing properties. Always use get_node_or_null() instead of get_node(). Always check has_signal() before connecting. Store references but re-validate in _process(). Pattern: `if not node or not is_instance_valid(node): return`. When class_name creates parse errors, use get_node_or_null() + has_method() checks to defer type resolution to runtime.

- **Cycles 130-134** [ranged-blood]: Ranged enemy pattern: maintain distance via retreat logic, hover motion via sin() offset to velocity.y, projectile = Area2D + inline GDScript with body_entered signal, visual feedback via orb flash on cast. Blood effect pattern: inline ColorRect creation in HealthComponent avoids class_name dependencies. Create drops as children of room (parent.get_parent()), use z_index=-3 for active drops, z_index=-4 for permanent stains. Do NOT tween permanent objects. Keep alpha low (0.3-0.4).

- **Cycle 140** [memory-system]: Echo memory pattern: proximity-based text fade using global_position.distance_to(), inline Label with modulate.a interpolation, metadata array storage on player. UI journal: Panel overlay toggled with Input check, ScrollContainer + VBoxContainer for list, autowrap_mode. Collection effect: radial particle burst + ethereal chord audio (multi-frequency sine waves).

- **Cycle 144** [directional-damage]: Directional damage pattern: Enemy takes damage via custom method (take_damage_from_direction) instead of direct HealthComponent access. This allows blocking logic based on attack angle. Alternative: Use Area2D overlap detection on shield visual to intercept damage.

- **Cycle 149** [darkness-system]: Darkness system pattern: CanvasLayer with high layer value (100) for full-screen overlay. ColorRect for darkness + child ColorRect for light circle positioned at player screen coords via get_global_transform_with_canvas().origin. Fuel as float with drain rate. Flicker via sin(phase). UI fuel bar as separate ColorRect child. Torch pickup creates overlay dynamically via set_script(load()).

- **Cycle 150** [hazard-pattern]: Ambient hazard pattern: Node2D with visual children, AudioStreamPlayer with inline AudioStreamGenerator. Detection via distance check in _physics_process(). Attack pattern: tween tendril extension, check hit during callback, retract. Pulse via sin(timer) for eye glow. Low-frequency growl (80-300Hz) + noise for organic feel. Keep frames under 256.

- **Cycle 152-153** [victory-ghosts]: Victory condition pattern: Use player metadata to track collectibles, UI polls in _process(), trigger once with set_meta guard. Fullscreen overlay = ColorRect child of CanvasLayer with high z_index. Enemy pattern: proximity-based visual fade using distance + alpha modulation. Dual-frequency descending sine = "echo" effect. Scale up + fade out for ethereal death. Keep ghost alpha 0.3-0.6.

- **Cycle 154-159** [ambient-creatures]: Ambient creature pattern: CharacterBody2D with collision_layer=0, wander behavior via timer + random direction, proximity detection for state changes. State machine (wander/hunt/rest) for varied behavior. Audio via inline AudioStreamGenerator, kept minimal (256 frames max, -18 to -28db). High frequency (2400Hz+) for small creatures. Pattern scales to any creature dynamic. Light-seeking: distance checks to player + metadata flags + group queries. Wing animation via sin() phase on child node size.- **Cycle 161** [correction] (inhabit): Spider pattern: State machine (CEILING/DROPPING/CLIMBING) controls silk thread behavior. Visual effect: silk line = ColorRect with dynamic size.y based on position delta. Audio: high-frequency clicks (1800Hz+) at -28db. Integration: Added _spawn_ambient_spiders() to room_base.gd _ready() for automatic population. Spiders use collision_layer=0 to avoid physics while maintaining visual presence.
- **Cycle 162** [correction] (fix): When room_base.gd has parse errors, ALL scenes that extend it fail to load. Fix the base class FIRST before attempting any new features. The error was attempting to add ambient spiders before verifying the base class compiled correctly.
- **Cycle 163** [discovery] (fix): When .tscn files report "referenced non-existent resource" for a .gd file that exists, the issue is a parse error in that .gd file preventing Godot from loading it. Fix: create the absolute minimal version that parses correctly, then rebuild features one at a time. The previous approach of rewriting the entire file with all features was wrong — it kept introducing new parse errors. Start small, verify it loads, then add features.
